              <h4>A text is a sequence of words. A text stays the same no matter how it’s rendered. Consider the sentence “I like pizza.” I can print that text on a piece of paper, or read it aloud, or save it in a file on my laptop.</h4>
            
              <h4> It’ll be the same text, just rendered
              different ways—visually, audibly, digitally.
              But when “I like pizza” is printed, typography gets involved.
              All visually displayed text involves typography—whether it’s on
              paper, a computer screen, or a billboard. Is typography an art?
              </h4>

              <h4>That’s like asking if photography is an art. Some
              photographers and typographers use techniques that raise their
              work to the level of art. But at their core, both photography and
              typography have a utilitarian function. The aesthetic component
              is separate. Being an effective typographer is more about
              good skills than good taste. And you can learn the skills.</h4>

            <h1> All Caps</h1>
            <h4> At standard body text sizes, capital letters—or simply caps—are harder to read than normal lowercase text. Why? We read more lowercase text, so as a matter of habit, lowercase is more familiar and thus more legible.</h4>

              <h4>  Furthermore, cognitive research has suggested that the shapes of lowercase letters—some tall (d h k l), some short (a e n s), some descending (g y p q)—create a varied visual contour that helps our brain recognize words. Capitalization homogenizes these shapes, leaving a rectangular contour.</h4>

              <h4>That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use caps. But use them judiciously. Caps are suitable for headings shorter than one line (e.g., “Table of Authorities”), headers, footers, captions, or other labels. </h4>
            
              <h4>Caps work at small point sizes. Caps work well on letterhead and business cards. Always add letterspacing to caps to make them easier to read, and make sure kerning is turned on.
              </h4>

            <h1>Color</h1>
            <h4>In typography, color is a term with two meanings.First, typographers will sometimes speak of a font as creating a certain color on the page—even when it’s black. Used this way, the word encapsulates a set of hard-to-quantify characteristics like darkness, contrast, rhythm, and texture.</h4>
            
              <h4> The second meaning is the usual one—color as the opposite of black & white. This was once an irrelevant topic, as most of us had to be satisfied with monochrome laser printers. These days, color printers are ubiquitous and more writing is delivered on screen.
              </h4>

              <h4>So color has become a practical consideration.On a page of text, nothing draws the eye more powerfully than a contrast between light and dark colors. This is why a bold font creates more emphasis than an italic font.</h4>

            <h1>Columns</h1>
            <h4>
            They’re unusual in legal documents, but I don’t object to columns in a long document like a contract or a settlement agreement. Columns are an easy way to get a shorter and more legible line length without using large page margins.</h4>
            
              <h4>  On a standard 8.5″ × 11″ page, two or three columns are fine. Four is too many. </h4>

              <h4>Usually columns look neatest when the rows of text are aligned vertically between columns (i.e., as if they were sitting on the same baseline). Look at a decent newspaper for an example. Getting this result takes a little extra effort.</h4>

            <h1>Watermarks</h1>
            <h4> A watermark is a notice (e.g., “Draft”, “Confidential”) that’s printed in the background of a page. Often in six-inch letters. Diagonally. In red.</h4>
            

              <h4>Watermarks interact poorly with the text, creating visual noise that distracts from reading. (It’s a variation
              of the problem noted in rules and borders.) Also, watermarks can darken considerably when photocopied,
              aggravating the problem.</h4>
